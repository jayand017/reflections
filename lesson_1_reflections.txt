How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It much easier to find bug via fc or diff commands rather than doing it manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I could revist my last code whenever required in future and make comparision between the two.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: You can set your commit point whenever you want
Cons: You can miss creating a commit point and later remember of creating it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It is better as we do not have to find exact copy of same two file while comparision.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log: list all the git commit along with id
git diff: we can use the commit id to compare changes made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I dont have to worry now, I can revert to the point in a minute where everything was working perfect

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I will start using it for my under going projects
